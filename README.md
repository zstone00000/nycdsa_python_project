NYCDSA Eurorack Python Project

--Abstract---
Eurorack is a product ecosystem where customers can buy parts to build synthesizers. The products are called 'modules' which each serve a limited number of functions. These modules can be wired together to create complex, custom synths. 

Most brands making Eurorack modules are small with limited resources - resources which were heavily affected by the supply chain issues following COVID19. It is then important for these small companies to be selective in deciding what products to make to stay competitive.  

We focus primarily on gaps in production for popular functionality, as price and size have a much less direct relationship to popularity. We provide results showing underproduction both for popular single functions and pairings of functions given their availability, and additionally analyze when redundancy in the product line should be encouraged or avoided. These insights can help these small manufacturers focus on features and feature combinations which can make their products the most competitive, and decide on the breadth of products they make.
